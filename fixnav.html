    HTML Introduction
        
        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. The Hypertext defines the link between web pages, and Markup defines the text document within tags to structure the web pages. This language annotates text so that machines can understand and manipulate it accordingly. HTML is human-readable and uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. This guide will help you understand and explain the workings of HTML with examples.
        Features of HTML
It is easy to learn and easy to use.
It is platform-independent.
Images, videos, and audio can be added to a web page.
Hypertext can be added to the text.
It is a markup language.
HTML Elements and Tags
HTML uses predefined tags and elements that instruct the browser on how to display the content. HTML elements include an opening tag, some content, and a closing tag. It’s important to remember to include closing tags. If omitted, the browser applies the effect of the opening tag until the end of the page.

This section will dive into the basic structure of an HTML page, which includes essential building-block elements like doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements.

Unlike other programming languages, HTML does not show output on the compiler.

Web browsers show the results of an HTML code. It reads HTML files and determines how to show content with the help of HTML tags.

Any web browser (Google, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, etc) can be used to open a . HTML file and view the results.

HTML History
HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.

Currently, we are using HTML5, which is the latest and most recent version of HTML.

Advantages of HTML
HTML is used to build websites.
It is supported by all browsers.
It can be integrated with other languages like CSS, JavaScript, etc.
Disadvantages of HTML
HTML can only create static web pages. For dynamic web pages, other languages have to be used.
A large amount of code has to be written to create a simple web page.
The security feature is not good.
Conclusion
In conclusion, mastering HTML is a fundamental step in your web development journey. This guide serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding HTML, from the basics to more advanced topics. Remember, HTML is more than just a markup language – it’s a powerful tool for creating engaging, accessible, and SEO-friendly websites.

The average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance, a home page, an about page, and a contact page would all have separate HTML files.

HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. A web browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.

All HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, consisting of a set of tags and attributes. HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, whereas an attribute describes the characteristics of an element. 

An inline element formats the inner content of block-level elements, such as adding links and emphasized strings. Inline elements are most commonly used to format text without breaking the flow of the content. 

For example, a  tag would render an element in bold, whereas the  tag would show it in italics. Hyperlinks are also inline elements that use an <a> tag and an href attribute to indicate the link’s destination:
    Just like any other computer language, HTML has its strengths and limitations. Here are the pros and cons of HTML:

    Pros:
    
    Beginner-friendly. HTML has a clean and consistent markup, as well as a shallow learning curve.
    Support. The language is widely used, with a lot of resources and a large community behind it.
    Accessible. It is open-source and completely free. HTML runs natively in all web browsers.
    Flexible. HTML is easily integrable with backend languages such as PHP and Node.js.
    Cons:
    
    Static. The language is primarily used for static websites. For dynamic functionality, you may need to use JavaScript or a back-end language such as PHP.
    Separate HTML page. Users have to create individual web pages for HTML, even if the elements are the same. 
    Browser compatibility. Some browsers adopt new features slowly. Sometimes older browsers don’t always render newer tags.
    HTML is used to add text elements and create the structure of content. However, it is not enough to build a professional and fully responsive website. So, HTML needs the help of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript to create the vast majority of website content. 

CSS is responsible for stylings such as background, colors, layouts, spacing, and animations. On the other hand, JavaScript adds dynamic functionality such as sliders, pop-ups, and photo galleries. These three languages are the fundamentals of front-end development.

Conclusion
HTML is the primary markup language found on the internet. Every HTML page has a series of elements that create the content structure of a web page or application. 

HTML is a beginner-friendly language with plenty of support and is mainly used for static website pages. HTML works best together with CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality. You can check out how to link CSS and HTML on our blog.

As HTML (before HTML5) is based on SGML,[2] its parsing also depends on the Document Type Definition (DTD), specifically an HTML DTD (e.g. HTML 4.01[3][note 1]). The DTD specifies which element types are possible (i.e. it defines the set of element types) and also the valid combinations in which they may appear in a document. It is part of general SGML behavior that, where only one valid structure is possible (per the DTD), its explicit statement in any given document is not generally required. As a simple example, the <p> tag indicating the start of a paragraph element should be complemented by a </p> tag indicating its end. But since the DTD states that paragraph elements cannot be nested, an HTML document fragment <p>Para 1 <p>Para 2 <p>Para 3 is thus inferred to be equivalent to <p>Para 1 </p><p>Para 2 </p><p>Para 3. (If one paragraph element cannot contain another, any currently open paragraph must be closed before starting another.) Because this implication is based on the combination of the DTD and the individual document, it is not usually possible to infer elements from document tags alone but only by using an SGML—or HTML—aware parser with knowledge of the DTD. HTML5 creates a similar result by defining what tags can be omitted.[4]

    SGML vs. XML
    SGML is complex, which has limited its widespread understanding and adoption. XML was developed as a simpler alternative. Although both can use the DTD to specify the supported elements and their permitted combinations as document structure, XML parsing is simpler. The relation from tags to elements is always that of parsing the actual tags included in the document, without the implied closures that are part of SGML.[note 2]
    
    HTML as used on the current web is likely to be either treated as XML, by being XHTML, or as HTML5; in either case the parsing of document tags into Document Object Model (DOM) elements is simplified compared to legacy HTML systems. Once the DOM of elements is obtained, behavior at higher levels of interface (example: screen rendering) is identical or nearly so.[note 3]
    
    %block; vs. box
    Part of this CSS presentation behavior is the notion of the "box model". This is applied to those elements that CSS considers to be "block" elements, set through the CSS display: block; declaration.
    
    HTML also has a similar concept, although different, and the two are very frequently confused. %block; and %inline; are groups within the HTML DTD that group elements as being either "block-level" or "inline".[6] This is used to define their nesting behavior: block-level elements cannot be placed into an inline context.[note 4] This behavior cannot be changed; it is fixed in the DTD. Block and inline elements have the appropriate and different CSS behaviors attached to them by default,[6] including the relevance of the box model for particular element types.
    
    Note though that this CSS behavior can, and frequently is, changed from the default. Lists with <ul><li> ... are %block; elements and are presented as block elements by default. However, it is quite common to set these with CSS to display as an inline list.
